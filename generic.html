							<p>Clever Gaming encourages learning through gaming by providing gamers and parents a tool to find out what different games can teach them. Clever Gaming is a wiki website where users can search for their desired game and see whether they can learn skills such as a language, history, mathematics or motorics from it. The website uses tags for each subject, making finding your desired subject easy.</p>
							<p>Research has shown that video games can aid the learning of several subjects, such as a language, mathematics, motorics or even history. Any game can teach something to the player, not just puzzle games and games specifically made for education purposes. In addition, people of all ages are spending more and more time gaming, so why not make your or your children's leisure time more productive by learning while playing, and having a great time in the meantime? </p>
