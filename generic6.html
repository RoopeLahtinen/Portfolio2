							<p>The marketing plan was developed on a course called Marketing in the Digital World (4 ects). Salipiste is a gym in Lempäälä, Tampere that wants to provide a suitable training environment for beginners and advanced gym-goers alike. Salipiste promises to be “everyone’s gym”, which our team wanted to emphasize in the digital marketing plan, too. Additionally, Salipiste wanted to showcase sustainable values in its marketing but did not know how to implement it into its marketing plan due to being a service-based business in the fitness industry. The team implemented three of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals into the brand identity of Salipiste to enable the company to execute its vision as a sustainable gym.</p>
							<p>The team used international benchmarking to learn more about the digital marketing of different gyms worldwide. In addition, the brand identity of Salipiste was developed further with a focus on digital marketing. Lastly, the team compiled a TiKTok user guide to help Salipiste get started on TikTok and implement a successful omnichannel strategy between its social media channels and website. The user guide was directed at a beginner TikTok user, and it was important for it to be easily understandable by the client, who intends to start TikTok marketing on their own.</p>
